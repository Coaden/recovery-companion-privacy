## 2. Privacy Policy

### 2.1 What We Collect
We may collect and process the following types of data:
- Non-personal usage data (e.g., session duration, feature usage)
- User-submitted content (e.g., journal entries, mood ratings)
- Device information (e.g., device type, OS version)

No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected unless explicitly provided by the user for feedback or support.

### 2.2 How We Use Your Data
We use collected data to:
- Improve app functionality and user experience
- Fix bugs and ensure app stability
- Conduct research to understand behavioral patterns and recovery trends

### 2.3 Anonymous Research Use
By using the App, you grant us the right to use anonymized and aggregated data for research, analytics, academic publication, or product improvement. No individual will ever be identified from this data.

### 2.4 Local Storage
Most user data (e.g., journaling, scores, preferences) is stored **locally** on your device. If we ever transmit data externally (e.g., for syncing or backups), it will be encrypted and disclosed in a future update of this policy.

### 2.5 Third-Party Services
The App may use third-party services (e.g., AI platforms, crash reporting tools). These services may collect anonymous usage data subject to their own privacy policies.

### 2.6 Security
We implement reasonable technical measures to protect user data. However, no system can guarantee complete security.

### 2.7 Data Retention
We retain anonymized and non-personal data indefinitely for analytical and product improvement purposes. Local data may be deleted by uninstalling the App.

### 2.8 Your Rights
You may request deletion of any personal data you’ve explicitly submitted. We do not currently offer account registration or login, so most data is local and user-controlled.
